### 📚 **Library Management System**  
A web-based Library Management System built using **FastAPI**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Streamlit** to manage book issuing, returns, and status updates efficiently.  

---

## 🚀 **Project Overview**  
This system provides a digital solution for **library staff** to manage book records. It allows employees to:  
✅ **Issue Books** – Updates book status to *Not Available*.  
✅ **Return Books** – Automatically updates status to *Available*.  
✅ **Check Book Status** – Retrieves real-time availability of books.  
✅ **Employee Login** – Secure authentication using **bcrypt-hashed passwords**.  

The backend is powered by **FastAPI**, handling API requests and communicating with a **PostgreSQL database**. The frontend is built using **Streamlit**, providing an interactive and user-friendly interface.

## 🛠 **Tech Stack**  
🔹 **Backend:** FastAPI (Python)  
🔹 **Frontend:** Streamlit  
🔹 **Database:** PostgreSQL (with Stored Procedures)  
🔹 **Authentication:** bcrypt (password hashing)  
🔹 **Deployment:** Local system (GitHub for version control)
